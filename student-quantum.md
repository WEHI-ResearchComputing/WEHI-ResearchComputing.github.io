# Research Software Engineer (Quantum Computing in Bioinformatics) 

## Introduction

Coming into this internship with no prior experience in quantum computing, we spent 12 weeks exploring its applications in bioinformatics and machine learning, hoping we could contribute something to WEHI for medical related issues.

We worked extensively with Qiskit and PennyLane, two leading quantum programming frameworks, to understand quantum circuits and algorithms. This involved writing code, debugging quantum programs, and gaining exposure to cloud-based quantum computing. The nature of quantum computing required us to approach problem-solving in a completely new way, as errors and optimizations in quantum systems function differently from classical computing.

However, since we think quantum computing is still in an early stage and remains highly theoretical, we realised that we had to switch our focus to work on educational resources rather than attempting immediate real-world applications. Moreover, recognizing the steep learning curve associated with quantum computing, my team decided to develop an interactive educational platform. We created a website designed to help beginners navigate quantum concepts more effectively. The platform incorporated flip cards, quizzes, and curated learning resources to simplify complex topics and provide an engaging learning experience. This project was particularly meaningful because it allowed us to contribute something tangible to the field; an accessible tool that can help others get started with quantum computing.
