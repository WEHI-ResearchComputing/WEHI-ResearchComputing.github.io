# Email - Week 5

Hi All,

This is your email to start week 5 of your internship. Now we are expecting you to understand the high-level problem and can talk to stakeholders/SMEs.


## WARNING: Do you have a problem? Please read this first

Many students ask their supervisor questions that could be easily solved within the team. Please read this [to find out when and how to send an email to your supervisor to ask a question](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#how-should-i-ask-for-help-to-solve-a-problem).


## Goals for the week

1. If you didn't pass last week, draw up the high-level problem on the whiteboard in front of your supervisor(s). They will ask you questions to see how well you know WHY the problem exists and WHY it causes researchers problems. 
2. If you pass, you will get permission to reach out to stakeholders and SMEs to setup a time to meet them in week 5. You will be provided with emails and asked to reach out to them to organise a time and day for the next week or two to meet with them.
3. As part of this email, you will need to write down some questions to give them an idea of what you are going to ask them.
4. You will behave in a professional way when you meet with stakeholders and subject matter experts,
5. You will provide a summary of the conversation and send it back to the stakeholders / SMEs to confirm you have understood what they have said, and
6. If you are meeting with the stakeholders/SMEs this week, make sure to thank them and add them to your acknowledgement slides in the final presentation.
7. Make sure you know when your final presentation is due. To find out actual the dates for your intake, go to [the Student intake dates page](intake_dates).

You can see the full list in [the key milestones and onboarding emails page](emails-and-key-milestones).

## Key things to do before for your regular weekly project meeting

1. Please meet as a team before the meeting without your supervisors to ensure you as a team of students are all on the same page
2. Please send a weekly email update 24 hours before the meeting with: 
  - what each student has done,
  - write down any questions you have for the meeting to use as an agenda,
  - provide a link to the wiki, and 
  - provide a link to the technical notes in Sharepoint
3. Remember to ask to record the meeting to more easily keep notes if needed
4. Document the action items and make sure they are in the weekly email update for next week
