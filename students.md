# Unpaid Student Internship Program

The WEHI Research Computing Platform regularly provides unpaid student internship opportunities through the University of Melbourne Data Science and Software Engineering programs. These internships are 100% remote. 

We have had 214 interns through the program since Semester 2, 2021 who have provided over 24 person years of effort to help us uncover and document complexity early in over 80 intern projects.

Out of the 14 anonymous reviews that have been given by students as at 11th of October 2024, our internships have been rated a 4.7 out of 5.


## Learn real world skills

We prepare students for the real-world by teaching them:
- how understanding the domain problem and the users is more important than technical skills, and [how to work on a complex, ambiguous project](complex-projects),
- showing them [how to become as independent as possible](faq#you-ask-us-to-be-as-independent-as-possible-how-can-we-do-that), 
- show them [how to document and share knowledge](email-week-two) to others in a professional manner,
- [explain how a software maturity model can help clarify expectations](software_maturity_model), and 
- teaching them how to work productively in a remote environment.

We even tell students how to try to avoid [the top 5 mistakes that students make](top-5-mistakes).

In our [Welcome Session, we talk about ways you can better learn real world skills](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28503338).

## Types of projects

Many of the projects work in the Data Analysis and [Research Software Engineering](https://rse-aunz.github.io/) space using High Performance Compute (HPC). We work across diverse projects such as imaging, cryo-EM, genomics, transcriptomics, clinical informatics, and capacity planning.

We mainly work with projects that use R and Shiny, Python, Julia, bash, while also making the most out of other technologies such as RStudio, Jupyter notebooks, PowerBI and other applications within the data analytics space.

## Open source contributors

Sometimes, we are in contact with students who cannot get course credit and are extremely keen to volunteer as an open source software contributor. In these situations, we have to be careful we do not act in an exploitative way. This is why [we have written our expectations of potential open source contributors to make the expectations more transparent](/expectations_open_source_contributors).
