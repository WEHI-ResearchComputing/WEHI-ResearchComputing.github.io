# RCP Discovery Internship Program

The WEHI Research Computing Platform regularly provides unpaid internship opportunities via the Discovery Internship Program. Interns can get course credit through the University of Melbourne Data Science and Software Engineering programs, and Open Source Contributors (volunteers) can also participate from around the world. 

These internships are 100% remote, and we have already hosted interns from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and both North and South America — every continent except Antarctica!

We have had 270+ interns through the program since Semester 2, 2021 who have provided over 24 person years of effort to help us uncover and document complexity early in over 80 intern projects.

Out of the 16 anonymous reviews that have been given by students as at 4th of June 2025, our internships have been rated a 4.6 out of 5.

# Why apply for an internship?

We assist students and early career professionals in transitioning to the real workforce by engaging them in multi-disciplinary teams on complex projects. Over the past four years, we have successfully assembled more than 70 multi-disciplinary teams.

## Types of projects

Many of the projects work in the Data Analysis and [Research Software Engineering](https://rse-aunz.github.io/) space using High Performance Compute (HPC). We work across diverse projects such as imaging, cryo-EM, genomics, transcriptomics, clinical informatics, and capacity planning.

We mainly work with projects that use R and Shiny, Python, Julia, bash, while also making the most out of other technologies such as RStudio, Jupyter notebooks, PowerBI and other applications within the data analytics space.
